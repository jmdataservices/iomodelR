<p align="center">This repo is the home of iomodelR, an IO Modelling package for R. This package aims to simplify the process of performing Leontief Input-Output Analyses and provide a platform from which more complex variations on these analyses can be conducted. Usage instructions and guidance are provided below</p>

# Overview

The **ioModellR** package aims to provide a single-package mechanism, driven by the *tidyverse*, to allow users to complete Leontief Input-Output analyses with little to no additional effort in completing the individual steps. In doing so, the package aims to create a superior workflow for more advanced analyses - reducing the burden of complex looping or algorithms that enable more complex analyses.

# Contribute

To contribute to this package, users must be familiar with the R language and best-practice with R package building and programming. Please see:

* CRAN [https://cran.r-project.org/index.html](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html)
* RStudio [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

Additionally, the [GitHub page for the package](https://github.com/jmdataservices/iomodelR) is the single repository of information.

# Getting Started

To begin with the iomodellR package, please download and install it using the *devtools* package in R:

```
install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_git("https://github.com/jmdataservices/iomodelR")

library(iomodelR)
```

Now that the package is loaded, we can draw out the IO data from the appropriate source.
